# 🔄 Markdown to HTML Converter App

A frontend-focused **Markdown to HTML Converter Application** that transforms Markdown syntax into valid HTML with instant visual feedback.

This project combines **parsing logic (JavaScript)** with **structured layout (HTML)** and **clean presentation (CSS)** to simulate a real-world text processing tool.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this application is to:
- Convert Markdown input into HTML output
- Practice regex-based parsing and rule execution
- Build a live preview–style text converter
- Demonstrate clean separation of logic, structure, and style

Logic + UI = real product thinking.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Live Markdown to HTML conversion
- Supports common Markdown syntax:
  - Headings
  - Bold and italic text
  - Inline code blocks
  - Links (if implemented)
- Clean, readable UI
- Client-side processing only
- Beginner-friendly and extensible architecture

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — structure and input/output layout  
- **CSS3** — styling and visual clarity  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — parsing and conversion logic  

No frameworks. No libraries. Pure fundamentals.

---

## 📁 Project Structure
- `index.html` — main HTML file with input/output areas
- `styles.css` — CSS file for styling the application   
- `script.js` — JavaScript file containing the Markdown to HTML conversion logic
- `README.md` — project documentation
- `.gitignore` — Git ignore file
- `LICENSE` — project license file


Organized for readability and easy iteration.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters Markdown text
2. JavaScript reads the input
3. Regex-based rules parse Markdown syntax
4. Equivalent HTML is generated
5. Output is rendered or displayed instantly

This mirrors real-world editor preview workflows.
